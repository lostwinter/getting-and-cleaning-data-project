=================================

## Introduction
This repository contains the course project files for the Coursera course "Getting and Cleaning data." This README.md describes the raw data, the script, the tidy data output, and the codebook.

## Files in this repository
<ul>
<li>README.md: This file</li>
<li>codeBook.md: Information about both the raw and tidy data set.</li>
<li>run_analysis.R: The R script used to transform raw data set into tidy data.</li>
</ul>


##Project Task
Make and R script called run_analysis.R 
<ol>
<li>Merge the 'training' and the 'test' sets to create one data set.</li>
<li>Extract the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.</li>
<li>Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set</li>
<li>Appropriately label the data set with descriptive activity names.</li>
<li>Make a new independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.</li>
</ol>

## Steps to use this data
<ol>
<li>Download the data file and put into a local folder.</li>
<li>Put run_analysis.R in the parent folder of UCI HAR Dataset.</li>
<li>Set it as your working directory using setwd() function in RStudio.</li>
</ol>
